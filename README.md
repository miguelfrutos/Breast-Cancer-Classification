# Breast-Cancer-Classification

This exercise is part of the excellent course ["Browser-based models with Tensorflow.js"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/browser-based-models-tensorflow/home/welcome) with deeplearning.ai and Laurence Moroney available in Coursera.

## Getting Your System Ready

In this exercise I have run all the examples and exercises locally on your machine. If you need to reproduce the code, you will need to have an internet browser, an HTML editor, and a web server installed on your machine. Throughout this exercise we are going to use Chrome as our internet browser,  Brackets as our HTML editor and the Web Server for Chrome App as our web server. All of these are free and are available for various platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

## Motivation
In this exercise, I will try to build and train a neural network that can predict from new data whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign. To train your network I will be using the given CSV data. The data has already been split into a training and a validation set. Going to the CSV files, you can notice that the first column corresponds to the  ‘diagnosis’ . The values in this column correspond to the diagnosis where a value of 1 indicates a malignant cancer, and a 0 indicates a benign one. Try to build a model that gives a very high accuracy on the test data.

## Structure
- breast_cancer.html
- /data: Folder that contains the train and test data both labelled.
  - wdbc-train.csv
  - wdbc-test.csv

## Neuronal Net with Tensorflow and Javascript
We are creating a classfier that can predict, from the data adapted from the  [Wisconsin](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) data, whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign. Check-out the code and follow the guidelines and hints given.

Hope you find this repo useful.
